This repository consists of just the code examples I talked about, with as much output as necessary to be understood without having to run everything yourself.  There were no slides.

### Scala ###

- [The specification of by-name parameters](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/04-basic-declarations-and-definitions.html#by-name-parameters)
- [`scala.util.Try`](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.util.Try)
- ... and its easily understandable [implementation](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.7/src/library/scala/util/Try.scala#L186)
- [More variants of implementing  `Delayed`](https://github.com/phipsgabler/dsl-examples/tree/master/src/main/scala/dsl_examples/delay)

### Clojure/LISP ###

- [A nice introduction into Clojure macros](http://bryangilbert.com/blog/2013/07/30/anatomy-of-a-clojure-macro/index.html)
- [The starting point into Clojure's docs about macros](http://clojure.org/macros) (although this often isn't very helpful)
- [A classic introduction into the `delay` construct in LISP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2Qt9uxhNSM&list=PL8FE88AA54363BC46&index=11) (from ["Structure and Interpretation of Programming Languages"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), my all-time favourite programming book and inspiration)
- ["Let over Lambda", _the_ book about LISP macros](http://www.letoverlambda.com) (more than you can digest at once...)

### R ###

- [The start page of the R project](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [R's official documentation about metaprogramming](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Computing-on-the-language) (quite useful, although you should know what you want before reading it)
- [A chapter from "Advanced R" about the same stuff, with more examples](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html)
- [(Probably) answer to the weird forcing effect](http://stackoverflow.com/q/34006356/1346276)
